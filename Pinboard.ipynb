    "\n",
    "Pinboard is a social bookmarking site where people share links to content and *tag* them by assigning a word that describes the content. These tags are free-form, and each user decides which ones to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pinboard has a nice [API](https://pinboard.in/api/) for interacting with your own bookmarks, but not for getting all public bookmarks for a tag. Pinboard also makes all tag pages available as RSS, e.g. https://feeds.pinboard.in/rss/t:covid-19 but it unfortunately doesn't allow paging back in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "So unfortunately we're going to have to scrape the pages. But fortunately this won't be too difficult with the [requests_html](https://requests-html.kennethreitz.org/) module because Pinboard has done such a nice job of using [semantic html](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_HTML)."
